ENHANCING SOFTWARE MAINTAINABILITY THROUGH 
MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFICATION TECHNIQUE FOR 
SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Voting Classifier demonstrate substantial accuracy gains over base models, achieving up to 87.85% in binary classification and 99.37% in multi-class classification, compared to the base models' maximum accuracies of 79.43% and 85.08%, respectively. These results highlight an effectiveness of advanced ML techniques in improving the accuracy of software maintainability assessments, underscoring their potential in better addressing security needs in software projects. Software maintenance is an expensive and time-consuming part of the software development life cycle. This phase begins the moment the software product is handed over to the client and concludes when the product is unused. The simplicity with which these adjustments may be executed is determined by the software product's maintainability, a quality characteristic.
